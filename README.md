### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm James (he/him) and I am a Junior Software Engineer at [Boulder Heavy Industries](www.boulderheavyindustries.com).

I first began programming by creating pretty terrible web applications in HTML and CSS when I was very young;
but now, I specialize in using Python and JavaScript to make APIs and websites (with Flask) and mobile applications (using React Native).

I studied Finance and Information Systems at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, where I received a BS in Business.

Currently, I am working on my website, which will be live (sooner or later) on [www.jameshe.xyz](www.jameshe.xyz).
