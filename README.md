### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm James (he/him) and I am a startup consultant at [Papa Bear Software](www.papabearsoftware.com), where I help startups build solutions rapidly and effectively. I am based in Bloomington, IN.

I first began programming by creating pretty terrible web applications in HTML and CSS when I was very young;
but now, I specialize in using Python and JavaScript to make APIs and websites (with Flask) and mobile applications (using React Native).
I am also rather capable when it comes to using PostgreSQL and managing devops, as well as project management, as I was once the technical lead for a startup here in Bloomington.

I studied Finance and Information Systems at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business, where I received a BS in Business.
So, as a result, I am also pretty good with Microsoft Office, including skills in VBA for workflow automation and productivity.

Currently, I am working on my website, which will be live (sooner or later) on [www.jameshe.xyz](www.jameshe.xyz).
